Smart Home Device Tracker
You’re building a Smart Home Device Tracker to monitor the status of electronic devices.
Your Tasks:
Create a class called SmartDevice.
Add a class attribute brand = "HomeTech" (default manufacturer).
In the constructor, accept:
device_name: Name of the smart device.
power_status: True (ON) or False (OFF).
Shadow the class attribute brand by assigning self.brand = "CustomBrand" (to simulate user modification).
Define a method get_status():
Returns a string like: "AC is ON - CustomBrand" or "Fan is OFF - CustomBrand" based on power_status.

class SmartDevice:
    brand = "HomeTech"

    def __init__(self, device_name, power_status):
        self.device_name = device_name
        self.power_status = power_status

        self.brand = "CustomBrand"

    def get_status(self):
        status = "ON" if self.power_status else "OFF"
        return f"{self.device_name} is {status} - {self.brand}"
