Student Scores Report
You’re building a simple student report generator that combines names and scores.
Tasks:
Define a function generate_score_report that takes two lists — one with student names and one with their scores.
Use the zip() function to pair each student with their score.
Return a list of strings in the format "Name scored X marks"

    report = []
    for names, scores in zip(names, scores):
        report.append(f"{names} scored {scores} marks")
