Task Completion Tracker
Instructions
Youâ€™re building a simple task tracker for a to-do app. Whenever a user completes tasks, your app should mark them as done.
Tasks:
Define a function mark_completed_tasks that accepts a list of task names.
Iterate through the list using a for loop, and update the format like "Completed:  {task}".
Return a new list with the updated task strings.

# This function will be tested automatically. 
# Do not change the function name or parameters.
def mark_completed_tasks(tasks: list[str]) -> list[str]:
    new_task = []
    for task in tasks:
        new_task.append(f"Completed: {task}")
    return new_task
