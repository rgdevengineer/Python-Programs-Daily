Student Grading System
You’re building an academic grading system.
Tasks:
Define a function calculate_grade(score) that:
Returns “A” for score ≥ 90
“B” for ≥ 75
“C” for ≥ 60
“D” for ≥ 40
“F” otherwise

Define a second function generate_student_report(name, score) that:
Uses the first function to determine the grade.
Returns a report string like: "Aman has scored 80 and received grade B"
Write clean, reusable code using functions, conditions, and string formatting.
