Even Greater than Odd

Given an array arr, rearrange the array according to the following relations :

arr[i] >= arr[i-1], if i is even.
arr[i] <= arr[i-1], if i is odd.
[Considering 1-base indexed array]

Return the rearranged array.

Note: The driver code will print "true" if your output array satisfies the conditions; otherwise, it will print "false".

Example:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 2, 1]
Output: [1, 2, 1, 2]
Explanation: Both 2s are at even positions and 1s at odd positions, satisfying the given conditions.
Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 2]
Output: [1, 3, 2]
Explanation: The array is already arranged according to the conditions.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 104

class Solution:
    def rearrangeArray(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)

        for i in range(1, n):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                if arr[i] > arr[i - 1]:
                    arr[i], arr[i - 1] = arr[i - 1], arr[i]
            else:
                if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                    arr[i], arr[i - 1] = arr[i - 1], arr[i]

        return arr
