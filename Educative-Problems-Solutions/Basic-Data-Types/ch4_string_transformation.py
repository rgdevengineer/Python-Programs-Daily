Challenge 4: String Transformation
This challenge will test your knowledge on string transformation using python.

Problem Statement
Given a getStr() function, write the necessary sequence of operations to transform the string (containing three literals) in such a way that every literal is tripledâ€‹ respectively.

Input
A string

Output
Triple of every string literal

Sample Input
abc

Sample Output
aaabbbccc
