Challenge 3: Return Sequence of Fibonacci Numbers
Use iterators to return a list containing the Fibonacci sequence.

Problem Statement
Edit the following iterator class to return the Fibonacci sequence from the first element up to the nth element.

The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers in which the next term is found by adding the two previous terms:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
Here , the number 0 is the first term, 1 is the second term, 1 is the third term and so onâ€¦

Input
A number n

Output
The range of fibonacci numbers from 0 to n

Sample Input
8

Sample Output
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
